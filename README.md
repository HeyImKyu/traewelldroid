# TrÃ¤welldroid

This is a community app for the open source project
[TrÃ¤welling](https://github.com/Traewelling/traewelling).

## How it is developed

The app is using the official AndroidX framework by Google. Crashes of the app are detected and
transmitted by [Sentry](https://sentry.io). For the production version of the app a self-hosted
Sentry instance is used.
